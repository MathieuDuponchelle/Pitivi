GES:
    Critical
    ========
        -> Implement riple and roll (could be done in pitivi for the time
                being reusing old code)
                => 3 to 5 days

        -> Handle reslution and framerate -> BLOCKER
            |-> Do we handle it as a "hack" in pitivi for the time being?
                => 3 to 5 days

        -> Implement waveform
            => 5 days

        -> Merge Ges-Port branch (all the list is BLOCKER)
            > Refactor and fix the formatter -> Done, needs some bugfixing
            > review and fix the whole branch
                => 2  to 5 days

           > Add an entry point for saving sourcelist -> pitivi must
                take advantage of it afterward

        total: 14 to 21 days left


    Less critical
    =============
        => acceptable regressions
            -> compostiting, this one implies a proper implementation of
                    "Handle reslution and framerate"
                => 15 to 20 days

            -> Handle keyframes
                => 5 days

            -> Fill gaps -> BLOCKER -> Background done

PiTiVi:

    Critical
    ========
        -> Make Seeker more powerfull, and rely only on it for all the
           seeking
            => 2 days

        -> Refactor the DND
            => 1 days

        -> Handle effects properly, ie dnd, settings etc
            => 2 days

        -> reimplement thumbnail + waveform
            => 5 days

        -> Reimplement undo-redo
            => 5 days

        -> Reimplement transformation
            => 1 days

        -> Implement properly rendering
            => 2 days

        -> Remove ALL references to the old PiTiVi core
            => 1 day left

        > Handle project settings
            => 2 days

        > Reimplement thumbnail in the sourcelist
            => 1 days

      Quality/margin tasks:

        -> Refactor the whole codebase
            => 0 to 10 days

        -> Bug fixing
            => 10 days

        total: 32 to 42 days

TOTAL: between 46 and 92 days of work



    Less critical
    =============
        -> Reimplement the auto-aligner
        -> Restore keyframes
            => 3 days
        -> Add more debugging symbols all around
        -> Kill the receiver
        -> Implement titles :)
